    "* Smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%). Overall passing rates dropped 20% (94% to 74%) in the large schools, compared to small and medium-sized schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school. \n",

    "* The average math and reading scores across all 4 grades are largely similar within each school, with a slightly wider range of scores in math than in reading.\n",

This discrepancy is smaller in the best performing schools, with students passing reading being 3% more than students passing math.\n",

    "* In the district as a whole, there are 11% more students passing reading than students passing math, even though the average reading score is only 3 points higher than the average math score. This could be due to the fact that the average math score is only 9 points away from a passing grade.\n",
