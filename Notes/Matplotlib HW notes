percent changes:
	tumor volume - select from mouse count df: df = df.iloc[:, [0, 1, 3]]
	*-1 references last row
	
	do data munging to have columns for each drug, then do:
	(df.iloc[-1, :] - df.iloc[0, :]) / df.iloc[0, :]
	last tumor volume - first tumor volume divided by first tumor volume
	
numbers for standard error for tumor sizes are not matching up with answer
